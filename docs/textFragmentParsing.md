# Text Fragment Parsing

Support for handling different text fragment URLs will gradually be added. The intended use case is to select text on a website, right click, then select "Copy link to highlight". 

From there, the copied link is pasted into Obsidian. The Gospel Study plugin then uses that URL to retrieve the highlighted text and format it as a study block.
