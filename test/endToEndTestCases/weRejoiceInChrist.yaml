  The kingdom of Babylon was a mighty political and military threat to ancient Israel. But to Nephi’s people—and to us today—the bigger threat is what Babylon represents: worldliness and sin. Consider how the warnings in <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/23?lang=eng">2&nbsp;Nephi 23–24</a> might have affected people who feared or admired or trusted Babylon’s wealth and power (see, for example <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/23.6-9,11,19-22?lang=eng#p6">23:6–9, 11, 19–22</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/24.10-19?lang=eng#p10">24:10–19</a>). What are some similar things we might fear or admire or trust today? What do you feel the Savior’s message to you might be in these chapters? Think about how you can show that you “rejoice in \[the Lord’s] highness” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/23.3?lang=eng#p3">2&nbsp;Nephi 23:3</a>).
